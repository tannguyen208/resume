        Looking for a position in the project where I could develop growing
        experiences, communicate with co-workers to increase product high
        quality, make product scalability, and optimize system's performance as
        well. Besides, I hope to join an environment which is able to learn,
        step up my skills as a Javascript Developer, improve self-skills and
        grow up with advanced opportunities to become a technical lead. Later, I

        available.
